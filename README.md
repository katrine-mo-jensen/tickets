## issues
 - when you register an event, you get "thrown out" as in the user is no longer registered in the browser so you have to log out and log in again to use the application
 - you can not use the image input when registering. It does not register the image URL, so i have to go to the DB and manually insert it. (Not even in postman does it work)
